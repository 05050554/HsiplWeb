                    HSIPL is dedicated to design and develop algorithms for multi/hyperspectral, 
                    medical and satellite images, specifically for image classification, 
                    endmember finding and target detection. In particular, 
                    we have wide interests in various research topics for multi/hyperspectral applications.
